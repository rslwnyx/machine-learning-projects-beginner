Overview

This repository contains a collection of machine learning and data science projects implemented from scratch, without relying on high-level libraries for model training. The goal of these projects is to deepen understanding of fundamental concepts, algorithms, and data preprocessing techniques by implementing them manually. Each project demonstrates the workflow from data collection and cleaning to model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

Projects:

Logistic Regression

-Description: Binary classification model implemented from scratch.
-Features: Gradient descent, loss calculation, accuracy evaluation.


Linear Regression

-Description: Predict continuous values using a linear model.
-Features: Gradient descent, mean squared error.
